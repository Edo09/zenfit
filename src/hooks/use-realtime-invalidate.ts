// supabase.channel(name) hands back the EXISTING channel when the name
// matches, and calling .on() on one that has already subscribed throws
// "cannot add postgres_changes callbacks … after subscribe()".
//
// Two things collide on a shared name. useNutritionPlan() calls useRoutines()
// internally, so the Rutinas tab and the Nutrición tab can hold two
// identical `routines` subscriptions at once — and in dev, Fast Refresh
// re-runs the effect while the old channel is still tearing down
// (removeChannel is async). A monotonic suffix sidesteps both.

/**
 * Invalidate a query whenever a row the client cares about changes on the
 * server — so a coach saving in the admin panel lands in the app immediately
 * instead of waiting for a pull-to-refresh that mobile web doesn't even offer.
 *
 * Invalidates rather than applying the payload: the screens read a nested
 * graph (routine → exercises; plan → slots → options → foods), and a realtime
 * event only carries the one row that changed. Refetching is both simpler and
 * correct; these are small, rarely-written tables.
 *
 * Requires the table to be on the `supabase_realtime` publication
 * (20260807130000_realtime_coach_content.sql,
 * 20260826120100_realtime_coach_routines.sql). RLS still applies, so a client
 * only ever receives rows they could already SELECT.
 *
 * No-ops when `filter` is undefined — callers pass `user_id=eq.${user?.id}`,
 * which isn't known until auth resolves.
