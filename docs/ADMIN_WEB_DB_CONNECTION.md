# Admin Web Panel — Database Connection Guide

**Project:** Hokage Coaching — Admin Web Panel
**Stack:** React SPA (Vite) + `@supabase/supabase-js`
**Backend:** the **same** Supabase project the mobile app already uses
**Status:** the coaching database migration is applied and live (`supabase/migrations/20260707120000_coaching_platform.sql`)

This document explains exactly how the web admin panel connects to the database and operates safely under the existing Row-Level Security (RLS) model. It is the source of truth for the panel's data layer.

---

## 1. Overview & Security Model

The panel is a **browser-only React SPA**. It talks to Supabase directly with `@supabase/supabase-js`. There is **no custom backend server** — with one exception (creating client accounts, see §6).

The security model rests on three facts already enforced in the database:

1. **RLS is the boundary, not the client.** Every table has Row-Level Security enabled. What a request can read/write is decided by Postgres based on the caller's JWT — never by trusting the browser.
2. **The coach's power comes from their role, via `is_coach()`.** There is exactly one coach (the gym owner). Their `profiles.role = 'coach'`. A security-definer function `public.is_coach()` returns true for that account, and additive RLS policies grant the coach **full CRUD across every client's data**. Clients (`role = 'user'`) stay scoped to their own rows.
3. **The anon key is public and safe to ship in the browser.** It grants *nothing* on its own — every request is still filtered by RLS against the signed-in user's JWT. The **service-role key is never shipped to the browser**; it lives only inside one server-side Edge Function (§6).

```

└─────────────────────────┘
```

## 2. Environment & Setup

The web panel reuses the **same project URL** and **same anon key** as the mobile app (mobile reads them as `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` / `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY`). For Vite, expose them with the `VITE_` prefix.

`.env` (Vite):

```dotenv
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://<your-project-ref>.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<anon public key>
```

Both values are found in the Supabase dashboard → **Project Settings → API**. The anon key is the **`anon` `public`** key — do **not** use the `service_role` key here.

Install and create a single shared client:

```bash
npm install @supabase/supabase-js
```

`src/lib/supabaseClient.ts`:

```ts
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";

export const supabase = createClient(
  import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL,
  import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY,
  {
    auth: {
      persistSession: true,      // keep the coach logged in across reloads
      autoRefreshToken: true,
      detectSessionInUrl: true,  // needed if you use magic-link / OAuth later
    },
  },
);
```

> **Never** create a browser client with the service-role key. That key bypasses RLS entirely; in a public SPA it would hand every visitor full database access.

---

## 3. Coach Authentication

The coach signs in with their normal Supabase account (the one whose `profiles.role` you set to `'coach'`). The JWT it returns is what makes `is_coach()` true on the server.

```ts
// Sign in
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
  email,
  password,
});
if (error) throw error;
```

**Verify the role after login** — the panel must refuse anyone who is not the coach. RLS already prevents a non-coach from *reading/writing* other users' data, but the UI should also gate access explicitly:

```ts
export async function assertCoach(): Promise<boolean> {
  const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
  if (!user) return false;
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from("profiles")
    .select("role")
    .eq("id", user.id)
    .single();
  if (error) return false;
  return data?.role === "coach";
}
```

Use this in a route guard: if `assertCoach()` is false, sign out and show a "not authorized" screen.

Session & sign-out:

```ts
supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange((_event, session) => {
  // update app auth state
});

await supabase.auth.signOut();
```

> The role-escalation trigger (`guard_role_change`) blocks any attempt to change `role` through the API, so a compromised client account cannot promote itself to `coach`. Roles are managed only via the Supabase dashboard / service role.

---

## 4. What RLS Grants the Coach

Once signed in as the coach, `is_coach()` is true and these additive **permissive** policies apply. Clients (`role = 'user'`) continue to see only their own rows.

| Table | Coach (via `is_coach()`) | Client (`role = 'user'`) |
|---|---|---|
| `profiles` | read + update **all** profiles | read/update **own**; read the coach profile |
| `routines` | full CRUD on **all** | CRUD **own** — but rows with `assigned_by` set are **read-only** |
| `routine_exercises` | full CRUD on **all** | CRUD **own** — read-only if the parent routine is assigned |
| `meals` | full CRUD on **all** | CRUD **own** — assigned meals read-only |
| `meal_items` | full CRUD on **all** | CRUD **own** — read-only if parent meal is assigned |
| `workout_logs` | read (+ CRUD) on **all** | CRUD **own** |
| `memberships` | full CRUD on **all** | read **own** only |

The client read-only rule is enforced by **restrictive** policies that AND onto the client's self-policies; the coach is explicitly exempt (`is_coach() OR ...`). So the coach can always edit an assigned plan; the client cannot.

**Provenance:** a plan is "assigned by the coach" when its `assigned_by` column holds the coach's `profiles.id`. `assigned_by = null` means the client made it themselves. The mobile app uses this to split each list into **"From your coach"** vs **"My own"**.

---

## 5. Core Operations (with `supabase-js` snippets)

All of these run in the browser with the coach's session; RLS authorizes them because `is_coach()` is true. Replace `clientId` / `coachId` with real UUIDs (`coachId` = the signed-in coach's `user.id`).

### List all clients

```ts
const { data: clients } = await supabase
  .from("profiles")
  .select("id, display_name, avatar_url, age, weight_kg, calorie_goal, onboarding_completed")
  .eq("role", "user")
  .order("display_name");
```

### Read one client's plans & progress

```ts
const { data: routines } = await supabase
  .from("routines")
  .select("*, routine_exercises(*, exercise:exercises(*, body_part:bodyparts(name)))")
  .eq("user_id", clientId)
  .order("created_at", { ascending: false });

const { data: meals } = await supabase
  .from("meals")
  .select("*, meal_items(*)")
  .eq("user_id", clientId);

const { data: logs } = await supabase
  .from("workout_logs")
  .select("*")
  .eq("user_id", clientId)
  .order("date", { ascending: false });
```

### Manage the exercise catalog

Exercises are a **shared library** (`public.exercises`), not per-routine free text — assigning "Bench Press" to five clients means picking the same catalog row five times, not retyping it. Only the coach can write to it; every signed-in user (coach + clients) can read it.

```ts
// List (e.g. for a picker in the routine-builder UI)
const { data: catalog } = await supabase
  .from("exercises")
  .select("*, body_part:bodyparts(name)")
  .order("name");

// Create — name is case-insensitively unique (unique index on lower(name)).
// Search the list above before creating to avoid a duplicate-key error.
const { data: exercise, error } = await supabase
  .from("exercises")
  .insert({ name: "Bench Press", video_url: "https://.../bench-press.mp4", body_part_id: chestId })
  .select()
  .single();

// Update — instantly updates every client this exercise is assigned to
// (routine_exercises stores only exercise_id, name/video are read live via join).
await supabase.from("exercises").update({ video_url: newUrl }).eq("id", exercise.id);

// Delete — fails with Postgres error 23503 (foreign key violation) if any
// routine_exercises row still references it. Catch this and tell the coach
// to reassign/remove those first rather than showing a raw DB error.
const { error: delErr } = await supabase.from("exercises").delete().eq("id", exercise.id);
if (delErr?.code === "23503") {
  // "Still assigned to one or more clients — remove it from their routines first."
}
```

### Assign a workout plan (this is what the mobile app shows under "From your coach")

Insert routine rows **into the client's account** (`user_id = client`) stamped with `assigned_by = coach`, then their exercises — referencing the catalog by `exercise_id`, not a free-text name.

```ts
const { data: routine, error } = await supabase
  .from("routines")
  .insert({
    user_id: clientId,
    assigned_by: coachId,          // <-- marks it coach-assigned + read-only for the client
    name: "Push Day",
    description: "Chest / shoulders / triceps",
    day_of_week: "monday",
  })
  .select()
  .single();
if (error) throw error;

// benchPressId / overheadPressId come from the exercises catalog (see above) —
// pick them from the list, don't type a name here.
await supabase.from("routine_exercises").insert([
  { routine_id: routine.id, user_id: clientId, exercise_id: benchPressId, sets: 4, reps: 8, sort_order: 0 },
  { routine_id: routine.id, user_id: clientId, exercise_id: overheadPressId, sets: 3, reps: 10, sort_order: 1 },
]);
```

> Set `user_id` to the **client's** id (not the coach's) and always include `assigned_by: coachId`. The insert guard rejects a client trying to fake `assigned_by`, but the coach is allowed.

### Assign nutrition

Two levers:

```ts
// (a) Set / override the client's daily calorie target
await supabase.from("profiles").update({ calorie_goal: 2200 }).eq("id", clientId);

// (b) Optionally seed assigned meals (appear read-only in the client's diary)
const { data: meal } = await supabase
  .from("meals")
  .insert({ user_id: clientId, assigned_by: coachId, name: "Lunch", meal_type: "lunch" })
  .select()
  .single();

await supabase.from("meal_items").insert([
  { meal_id: meal.id, user_id: clientId, name: "Chicken & rice", calories: 600, protein_g: 45, carbs_g: 60, fat_g: 12 },
]);
```

### Manage a membership

```ts
// Create or update a client's membership (coach-managed status; no in-app payment)
await supabase.from("memberships").upsert({
  client_id: clientId,
  coach_id: coachId,
  plan_name: "Monthly",
  status: "active",              // 'active' | 'expired' | 'paused' | 'cancelled'
  price: 50,
  currency: "USD",
  started_at: "2026-07-01",
  expires_at: "2026-08-01",
});
```

The client's mobile app reads this and shows status + a renewal reminder when it nears/passes `expires_at`.

### Set the coach's own WhatsApp (shown to clients on mobile)

```ts
await supabase
  .from("profiles")
  .update({ whatsapp: "5215512345678" }) // international digits only, no + or spaces
  .eq("id", coachId);
```

---

## 6. Creating Client Accounts (the one server-side piece)

Creating a login is the **only** operation that cannot run in the browser: it needs the Supabase Admin API (`auth.admin.createUser`), which requires the **service-role key**. That key must never touch the SPA. Put it behind a Supabase **Edge Function** named `create-client`.

### 6.1 The Edge Function

`supabase/functions/create-client/index.ts`:

```ts
import { createClient } from "jsr:@supabase/supabase-js@2";

const cors = {
  "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*", // tighten to your panel's origin in production
  "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "authorization, content-type",
  "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "POST, OPTIONS",
};

Deno.serve(async (req) => {
  if (req.method === "OPTIONS") return new Response("ok", { headers: cors });

  try {
    const authHeader = req.headers.get("Authorization") ?? "";

    // 1) Verify the CALLER is the coach, using their JWT + the anon key (RLS applies).
    const caller = createClient(
      Deno.env.get("SUPABASE_URL")!,
      Deno.env.get("SUPABASE_ANON_KEY")!,
      { global: { headers: { Authorization: authHeader } } },
    );
    const { data: { user } } = await caller.auth.getUser();
    if (!user) return json({ error: "unauthenticated" }, 401);

    const { data: me } = await caller
      .from("profiles").select("role").eq("id", user.id).single();
    if (me?.role !== "coach") return json({ error: "forbidden" }, 403);

    // 2) Do the privileged work with the SERVICE ROLE (server-only secret).
    const admin = createClient(
      Deno.env.get("SUPABASE_URL")!,
      Deno.env.get("SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY")!,
    );

    const { email, display_name } = await req.json();

    const { data: created, error } = await admin.auth.admin.createUser({
      email,
      email_confirm: true,
      user_metadata: { display_name },
      // Omit password and send an invite/reset instead (preferred — see below).
    });
    if (error) return json({ error: error.message }, 400);

    // The handle_new_user trigger auto-creates the profile row (role defaults to 'user').
    // Optionally trigger a password-set email so the client chooses their own:
    await admin.auth.admin.generateLink({ type: "recovery", email });

    return json({ user_id: created.user?.id }, 200);
  } catch (e) {
    return json({ error: String(e) }, 500);
  }
});

function json(body: unknown, status = 200) {
  return new Response(JSON.stringify(body), {
    status,
    headers: { ...cors, "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  });
}
```

Deploy and set the secret:

```bash
supabase functions deploy create-client
supabase secrets set SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<service role key>
# SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY are provided to functions automatically.
```

> **Prefer invite/reset email over returning a plaintext password.** `generateLink({ type: 'recovery' })` (or `inviteUserByEmail`) lets the client set their own password and avoids handling secrets in the UI.

### 6.2 Calling it from the SPA

```ts
const { data, error } = await supabase.functions.invoke("create-client", {
  body: { email: "client@example.com", display_name: "Jane Doe" },
});
// supabase.functions.invoke automatically attaches the coach's JWT as the
// Authorization header, which the function uses to verify role === 'coach'.
```

The new account is created with `role = 'user'` (the default), so the coach immediately sees it in the clients list (§5) and can start assigning plans.

## 7. Security Checklist

- [ ] **Service-role key is never in the SPA** — only in the `create-client` function's secrets.
- [ ] The SPA uses the **anon** key; all access is mediated by RLS.
- [ ] Post-login **`role === 'coach'` guard** on every admin route (`assertCoach`).
- [ ] The `create-client` function **verifies the caller is a coach** before using the service role.
- [ ] Rely on RLS for data isolation — do **not** re-implement authorization in the browser (belt-and-suspenders UI checks are fine, but the DB is the boundary).
- [ ] The **role-escalation trigger** and **restrictive read-only guards** are already in the DB; do not weaken them.
- [ ] Validate inputs on write: emails (create-client), and **WhatsApp as international digits only** (`^\d{8,15}$`, no `+`/spaces) so `https://wa.me/<digits>` works on mobile.
- [ ] Tighten the Edge Function CORS `Allow-Origin` to the panel's real domain before launch.

## 8. Schema Reference

Source of truth: **`supabase/migrations/20260707120000_coaching_platform.sql`** and **`supabase/migrations/20260708120000_exercise_catalog.sql`** (plus the base `supabase-schema.sql`, which is not fully in sync with either migration). Columns and objects the panel depends on:

**Columns added for coaching**

| Column | Table | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `role` | `profiles` | `'user'` (client) or `'coach'`. Drives `is_coach()`. Default `'user'`. |
| `whatsapp` | `profiles` | Coach's contact number (international digits). Shown to clients on mobile. |
| `assigned_by` | `routines`, `meals` | `null` = self-made; coach's `profiles.id` = coach-assigned (read-only for the client). |

**Membership table** — `public.memberships`: `client_id`, `coach_id`, `plan_name`, `status` (`active`/`expired`/`paused`/`cancelled`), `price`, `currency`, `started_at`, `expires_at`, `notes`.

**Exercise catalog** — `public.exercises`: `id`, `name` (case-insensitively unique), `video_url`, `body_part_id` (→ `bodyparts.id`), `created_at`, `updated_at`. Coach-writable only (`is_coach()`), readable by everyone. `routine_exercises.exercise_id` (→ `exercises.id`, `not null`, `on delete restrict`) replaced the old per-row `name`/`video_url` text columns — those are gone after the cleanup migration ran.

**Helper functions (security definer)**

| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `is_coach()` | True when the caller's profile role is `coach`. Gates all coach RLS policies. |
| `is_assigned_routine(uuid)` / `is_assigned_meal(uuid)` | Used by restrictive policies to keep assigned plans read-only for clients. |
| `guard_role_change()` (trigger `trg_guard_role_change`) | Blocks role changes made through the API (clients cannot self-promote). |

**Auth trigger** — `handle_new_user` (base schema): auto-inserts a `profiles` row on signup, so `create-client` does not insert the profile manually.

---

## 9. Optional Enhancements

- **Realtime dashboard.** Subscribe to changes for a live view of client activity:

  ```ts
  supabase
    .channel("workout_logs")
    .on("postgres_changes",
      { event: "INSERT", schema: "public", table: "workout_logs" },
      (payload) => { /* refresh UI */ })
    .subscribe();
  ```

- **Pagination** for large client lists — use `.range(from, to)` on the `profiles` query.
- **Coach-only content later** (announcements): add tables with `is_coach()` write policies + public/`user` read policies, following the same pattern as this migration. (The exercise library described here is already built — see §5 "Manage the exercise catalog" and §8.)

---

## 10. Quick Verification

Against a scratch Vite app wired to the same project:

1. Sign in as the coach → `assertCoach()` returns true; a `user` account is rejected.
2. List clients → returns all `role='user'` profiles.
3. Assign a routine to a client (`assigned_by = coachId`) → open the **mobile** app as that client → it appears under **"From your coach"**, badged and non-deletable.
4. Upsert a membership with `expires_at` a few days out → the client's mobile Profile shows the status + renewal reminder.
5. Call `create-client` → a new `role='user'` account is created and appears in the clients list; the client receives a set-password email.

Every SQL object referenced here exists in the applied migration `20260707120000_coaching_platform.sql`.
